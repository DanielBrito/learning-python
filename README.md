# :snake: Learning Python

These examples cover different aspects of several development tools and concepts related to Python from my [self-learning](https://github.com/DanielBrito/self-learning) studies.

I'm also exploring Python on [Blender Scripting Environment](https://github.com/DanielBrito/blender-scripting).

I recommend the course [Introduction to Computer Science and Programming in Python](https://github.com/DanielBrito/intro-to-computer-science-python) from MIT.
